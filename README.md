### Hello, I'm Siew Lin  <img src="https://github.com/SiewLinYap/SiewLinYap/blob/main/assets/wave.gif" width="30px">

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Product Engineering, AI Innovation @ AI Singapore
  - ðŸ’¬ I was an experienced package development engineer in the past ( hardware development on Integrated Circuit assembled package ). I'm using the transferable skillsets and engineering concepts to transform myself into another package development engineer, this time on software. I'm the python package core developer for [Rarity](https://pypi.org/project/rarity/)
  - :office: I also built a portal for the current organization to collate industrial machine learning projects for better collaboration and knowledge-sharing among engineers.
  - :clock530: During my free times, I like playing board games / cards. I like :books: , :bike: and :swimmer: too
  - ðŸŒ± I continue to explore, learn and experiment topics related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science
  - âš¡ Fun fact: I used to conquer the fear of motorbike by learning how to ride a motorbike. So I conquer the fear of software package by building one myself from scratch :sweat_smile:
